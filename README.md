  Git Geek Dashboard
</h1>
  The special Readme repository that was introduced a while ago, lets the user to easily write a cool bio, and see his/her stats. However, one thing missing there was a catchy visualisation of one's Github statistics.
  Seeing the detailed information provided by GitHub API, I thought of playing around it and developing something along the lines of Github Visual Dashboard.

<p align="center"><img src="./src/images/gitGeek.gif" alt="gitGeek gif" /></p>
<br/><br/>
  <b>GIT GEEK dashboard</b> provides various features with enhanced UI

    1. Your global stats ( Repos, Followers, Following, Gists)
    2. Your Profile
    3. Followers' Card
    4. Distribution of languages used in your Repos
    5. Stars per language stats
    6. Popular Repositories- forks status
    7. Popular Forks - Most forked repos stats

To get started, fill in your `username` or any `Github username`.
<br/>
You then have access to profiles and stats of any github user, where you learn from the vast pool of contributors' work ( and a comparision once in a while for motivation or self-validation never harms ;-) ).

Feel free to give a star and fork if you like it
